              <p class="blurbText">
              Each team's FPI is completely based on real in game statistics. The first step was to choose which statistics we wanted to analyze. Our initial list consisted of 48 unique statistics, which was eventually narrowed down to 23. To understand the relationship that different statistics had with the outcome of a game, we looked at a large range of games from the 2018-19 season and recorded stat values for both teams and associated each value with a win or a loss. For each statistic, this process was completed for up to 20 games.

            </div>
            <div class="blurb">
              <p class="blurbText">
              Then the data was grouped into regions based on the value of the statistic. Each region was converted into ordered pairs: (average stat value, percentage of games won). These ordered pairs were then put into a program in Wolfram that performed logistic regression. This function now accurately represents a team's percent chance to win when their statistical values for the season were entered. Each statistic has its own unique logistic function.

            <div class="blurb">
              <p class="blurbText">
              The FPI for each team is calculated by inserting the team's current stat value (retrieved from nfl.com) into each logistic function and calculating the sum of all of the functions.
